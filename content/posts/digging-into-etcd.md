## What Is etcd?

[etcd] per the official site is:

> A distributed, reliable key-value store for the most critical data of a distributed system

I presume `etcd` is a play on `/etc` and the long history of nameing [daemons]
with a `d` suffix, a daemon for your `/etc` config, though I've not yet found
proof of this.

[Kubernetes] uses etcd as the [backing store for cluster data][k8s-uses-etcd],
which drove my own interest in collecting the information in this post.

Clearly a lot of clusters out there are using etcd for critical data storage,
but how does it work?

## History

For a history of etcd see: https://coreos.com/blog/history-etcd

For bonus points: https://www.wired.com/2013/08/coreos-the-new-linux/

Roughly etcd was created out of a desire for a distributed data store addressing
the following issues:

- Google's [Chubby Paper] was public, but Chubby itself was / is not.

- Zookeeper was expensive to run, didn't scale down, and couldn't be interacted
with via common simple tools like [curl].

Initially etcd was used by coreOS' `fleet` container orchestration system,
but it was quickly adopted for other uses and later donated to the [CNCF].


## Architecture

### Overview

- `etcd` is a Go binary with a seperate CLI (`etcdctl`).

- etcd exposes a [gRPC] service along with an HTTP JSON API.

- Data is persisted in multiversion key-value format, stored on disk.

- Typically one, three, or five replicas are used.

- Each replica stores the full dataset, following the leader.

### Data Model

etcd's upstream documentation is instructive here: [github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/learning/data_model.md](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/learning/data_model.md)

### Consensus

Leader election is used to maintain a single leader replica, all requests
are routed to the leader internally and comitted only after acheiving consensus
on the request.

[Raft] is the [consensus algorithm] used both requests and for leader elections. 
The official [raft site][Raft] is a a good reference for understanding how this works. 
Another great resource linked from the official site is [thesecretlivesofdata.com/raft/].

etcd's [raft implementation][etcd-raft-implementation] is widely used and 
contains some useful documentation.

### Storage

Data is stored with a [memory-mapped][memory-mapped] [B+ tree] using [bbolt], a fork of [bolt], inspired by [LMDB].

## TODO

- elaborate on Kubernetes's usage
- talk more aboult multiversion and revisions
- talk more about data model
- talk more about supported operations
